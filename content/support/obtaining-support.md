If you need to report a security vulnerability in one of makedeb's products, please see [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](/support/reporting-security-vulnerabilities).
{{< /notice >}}

makedeb uses [Matrix](https://matrix.org) as its primary method for communication and support. All rooms are also accessible via a Discord server, though note that most of makedeb's users will be found on Matrix.

## Matrix Rooms

All rooms are joinable via the Matrix space at [#makedeb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb:matrix.org).

If your client doesn't support Matrix spaces, you can join each room individually:
- makedeb: General ([#makedeb-general:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-general:matrix.org))
- makedeb: MPR ([#makedeb-package-repository:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-package-repository:matrix.org))
- makedeb: Prebuilt-MPR ([#makedeb-pbmpr:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-pbmpr:matrix.org))


## Discord

The Discord server can be joined at https://discord.gg/R3MhyghtMD.
