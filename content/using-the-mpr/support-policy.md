At any given time, the MPR only expects package maintainers to support the latest Ubuntu LTS release.

More specifically, this LTS release is the latest LTS release that has a point release made (i.e. the Ubuntu 20.04 releases would be the latest LTS until Ubuntu 22.04.1 is released).

Support for any other distribution is up to the discretion of the package maintainer, though it is highly encouraged to support other distributions when feasible.
