makedeb distributes releases through three update channels: `stable`, `beta` and `alpha`.

`stable` is the tested, known-to-work release of makedeb, which is ready to be used inside of production environments.

`beta` is regularly synced from the `alpha` branch. This release serves as the entrypoint for bringing new features to the stable release, and is where most testing takes place.

Lastly, `alpha` is the cutting-edge build, which receives updates as soon as changes are pushed to the Git repository, allowing users to see changes as soon as they are made. Users of this channel should prepare (and expect) for breakage from time to time.
