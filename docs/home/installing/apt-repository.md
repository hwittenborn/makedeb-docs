The primary method for installation of makedeb on Debian-based systems is through the use of makedeb's APT repository.

Besides distributing makedeb itself, the repository also holds dependencies that makedeb needs to function properly.

!!! note
    These instructions are also applicable to distributions based on Debian, such as Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, and the various [Ubuntu flavors](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours).

## Repository Configuration
First, add the signing key:

```sh linenums="1"
wget -qO - 'https://{{env.proget_url}}/debian-feeds/makedeb.pub' | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/makedeb-archive-keyring.gpg &> /dev/null
```

Next, add the repository information to your system:

```sh linenums="1"
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/makedeb-archive-keyring.gpg arch=all] https://{{env.proget_url}}/ makedeb main' | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/makedeb.list
```

Lastly, update the repository cache on your system:

```sh linenums="1"
sudo apt update
```
