To use the MPR, you must first have [makedeb](/makedeb/intro.md) installed on your system.

The MPR is also designed first and foremost for Debian-based distributions, and there is thus no guarantee on usability for Arch-based systems.

To begin using the MPR, head over to the [MPR homepage](https://{{env.mpr_url}}), and create an account.
